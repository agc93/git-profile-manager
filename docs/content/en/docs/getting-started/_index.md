  Getting started with GPM, including installing and running

In general terms, you need to download GPM, [install it](/docs/getting-started/installation) then you're [ready to start](/docs/getting-started/usage)!

### Downloading

The latest release of GPM is always available [from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agc93/git-profile-manager/releases). Each release is published as native packages (`.rpm`, `.deb`, etc) as well as just the binary for all supported platforms (`gpm-{platform}-x64.zip`).
