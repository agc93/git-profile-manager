  Update history for Git Profile Manager

## 0.1.0

This initial release is the first full publish of the Git Profile Manager tool, never fully released.

## 0.2.0

This re-release is updated for .NET Core 3.1+ and the newer Spectre.Cli. This should be functionally equivalent to 0.1.0, but more reliable.

In general terms, you need to [install the tool](/docs/getting-started/installation/), then you can [start using GPM](/docs/getting-started/usage/)!
